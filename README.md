# LinkLiner

LinkLiner is a chrome extension that helps colorblind people locate links on a
web page easily. Instead of highlighting, we underline the links on the webpage.
Because there are various kinds of colorblindness, and an arbitrary highlighting
color would be inconsiderate to other colorblind people.
