# Link Liner

LinkLiner is a chrome extension that helps colorblind people locate clickable texts on a
web page easily. 

## Motivation
Originally we wanted to come up with a tool that could make webpages friendlier for color blind users by modifying colors. However, we came across an article that states, "it is not possible to predict what a color blind users sees with 100% accuracy" as there are different types of color blindness.

We took inspiration from some of the suggestions made by the article, and learned that clickable areas and texts on the web are often delineated by color which can create challenges to users with color deficiencies. Therefore we decided to create Link Liner to underline all clickable texts on a webpage to help color blind users locate clickable texts quickly.
